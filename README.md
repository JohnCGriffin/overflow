### Install

*This is a special README before the PR is merged by the upstream.*

This repository forks from `johncgriffin/overflow` and adds overflow detection for unsigned integer arithmetic and type conversions between integers.

It has been well tested and benchmarked, and passed the code security scan provided by Github Workflow.

[![CodeQL](https://github.com/rwxe/overflow/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rwxe/overflow/actions/workflows/codeql.yml)

```sh
go get github.com/rwxe/overflow
```

In order to be compatible with the old code and keep the code simple and readable, the new code still does not use generics, but uses templates to generate code. So the majority of repetitive code is generated by `overflow_template.sh`. 

If you have to change an algorithm, change it there and regenerate the Go code via: 
```sh
go generate
```
### Synopsis

#### Arithmetic overflow detection
```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "math"
import "github.com/rwxe/overflow"

func main() {
	addend := math.MaxInt64 - 5
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		sum, ok := overflow.Add(addend, i)
		fmt.Printf("%v+%v -> (%v,%v)\n",
			addend, i, sum, ok)
	}
}
```
yields the output
```go
9223372036854775802+0 -> (9223372036854775802,true)
9223372036854775802+1 -> (9223372036854775803,true)
9223372036854775802+2 -> (9223372036854775804,true)
9223372036854775802+3 -> (9223372036854775805,true)
9223372036854775802+4 -> (9223372036854775806,true)
9223372036854775802+5 -> (9223372036854775807,true)
9223372036854775802+6 -> (0,false)
9223372036854775802+7 -> (0,false)
9223372036854775802+8 -> (0,false)
9223372036854775802+9 -> (0,false)
```
For (u)int types, provide (U)Add, (U)Sub, (U)Mul, (U)Div, (U)Quotient, etc.


#### Type conversion overflow detection
```go
func main() {
	var i uint
	for i = math.MaxInt - 5; i <= math.MaxInt+5; i++ {
		ret, ok := overflow.UintToInt(i)
		fmt.Printf("%v -> (%v,%v)\n",
			i, ret, ok)
	}
}
```
yields the output
```go
9223372036854775802 -> (9223372036854775802,true)
9223372036854775803 -> (9223372036854775803,true)
9223372036854775804 -> (9223372036854775804,true)
9223372036854775805 -> (9223372036854775805,true)
9223372036854775806 -> (9223372036854775806,true)
9223372036854775807 -> (9223372036854775807,true)
9223372036854775808 -> (-9223372036854775808,false)
9223372036854775809 -> (-9223372036854775807,false)
9223372036854775810 -> (-9223372036854775806,false)
9223372036854775811 -> (-9223372036854775805,false)
9223372036854775812 -> (-9223372036854775804,false)
```
Provide UintToInt, IntToUint, Uint64ToInt32, Int32ToUint64, etc.

### Stay calm and panic

There's a good case to be made that a panic is an unidiomatic but proper response.  Iff you believe that there's no valid way to continue your program after math goes wayward, you can use the easier Addp, Mulp, Subp, Divp, IntToUintp, UintToIntp versions which return the normal result or panic.

### Performance considerations

Compared with the integer type safety libraries of other languages (such as C++), this library uses some seemingly slow operations, such as division. But this does not mean that these methods will be slow, on the contrary, it will be faster than complex implementations in other languages. The reason is that Go does not allow forced inlining, and any complex functions will be abandoned for inlining, resulting in additional calling overhead. Short functions are lightning fast due to automatic inlining. For example, for unsigned 64-bit integer multiplication overflow detection, when inlining is disabled, division takes five times as long as long multiplication, but after automatic inlining is allowed, division takes 1/5 of long multiplication.

Note that using `//go:noinline` in your business function will not affect the inlining of the library function. Only disabling global inlining through `-gcflags="-l"` will affect the inlining of this library function.

### Basis and dependencies

This library is based on Go's official compiler implementation and language specification, which defines the behavior when integer overflow occurs.
